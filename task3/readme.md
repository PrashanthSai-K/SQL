# Task 3: üìä Simple Aggregation and Grouping in SQL

### üéØObjective :

- Write SQL queries to summarize and analyze data using aggregate functions and grouping.


###  üõ†Ô∏è TechStack :

- SQL (Structured Query Language))
- Relational Database Management System (MYSQL)
- SQL Aggregate Functions (`COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`)
- Grouping with `GROUP BY`
- Filtering groups with `HAVING`

### üí° Features :

- Data Aggregation ‚Äì Perform calculations like sum, average, and count.  
- Grouping Data ‚Äì Organize records into meaningful groups.   
- Filtering Aggregated Data ‚Äì Use `HAVING` to filter grouped results.
